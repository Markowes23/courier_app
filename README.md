# Courier App

This simple Tkinter application helps manage delivery stops and cargo for a courier van.

## Features

- **Vehicle details** – enter the van make, model and cargo capacity in cubic metres.
- **Stops list** – add delivery stops with address, estimated time and package volume.
- **Progress tracking** – as each stop is completed a progress bar updates from 0–100%.
- **Cargo monitoring** – the interface shows remaining cargo space at all times.

Run the app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The GUI presents fields for vehicle data at the top, a section for adding stops and a progress display. Confirming each stop reduces the cargo load and updates remaining capacity.
